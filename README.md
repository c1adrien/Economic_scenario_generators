# sensitivity_analysis
Economic scenario generators are essential tools for meeting regulatory requirements in insurance. They allow projecting economic variables over horizons of several decades. Their objective is to provide asset-liability models with the means to value insurersâ€™ future liabilities and assets. Economic scenario generators model interest rates, equities, risky bonds, as well as correlations between these different variables. They naturally rely on more or less complex models. Some parameters, known as embedded parameters, are sometimes calibrated only once a year, such as the correlation matrix. It is then legitimate to wonder whether these embed- ded parameters should be recalculated when market conditions change, and to quantify these changes in market conditions.
Sensitivity analysis can be performed using classical methods (Sobol indices, Shapley in- dices, etc.). But in this thesis, we propose to go a step further and suggest new approaches for calculating sensitivity indices. The aim is to be able to prioritize the importance of embedded parameters. We also propose a methodology for classifying and generating market data, in or- der to understand the behavior of our economic scenario generator depending on the economic context, and depending on the inputs we provide it with.
