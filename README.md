# Economic scenario generators
- We propose a detailed sensitivity analysis of the embedded parameters of a GSE, namely the correlation matrix of risk factors. The impact of these parameters on the VIF and the BE is calculated for a benchmark ALM model.
- We propose MICE, a deep learning model that calculates visually interpretable sensitivity indices.
- We classify market data using a variational autoencoder (implicit volatility surfaces for European options and swaptions) to refine the impact of parameters based on market regimes.
